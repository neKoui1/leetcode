# My leetcode solutions
# 2022.4.29
Now I have written 88 questions (which is a convivial number in Seres) on the leetcode website, and I am planning to select some valuable questions to review and implement them in another programming language to improve myself when I reach the goal of 100 questions.  

No directory and probably No notes. I write this just for learning language syntax and exercise my programming skills.  
P.S. However for now I am still a rookie (눈_눈)  

Sorry for that most are simple.

Writing questions of medium in Go and reviewing previous quesions in Java will be preferred in the next stage.
