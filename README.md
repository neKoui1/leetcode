# My leetcode solutions
# 2022.4.29
Now I have written 88 questions (which is a convivial number in Seres) on the leetcode website, and I am planning to select some valuable questions to review and implement them in another programming language to improve myself when I reach the goal of 100 questions.  

No directory and probably No notes. I write this just for learning language syntax and exercise my programming skills.  
P.S. However for now I am still a rookie (눈_눈)  

Sorry for that most are simple.

Accomplish 100 questions!

Writing questions of medium in Go and reviewing previous quesions in Java will be preferred in the next stage.

I am always feeling tired when confronted with final exams every term.

And it is a bit difficult for me to learn Java and its unique and massive dissimilar objects and write some troublesome algorithms

For example, I do not know how to convert class List to basic data structure array(not Array!) except in the loop body, and I can not understand why Integer and int is not equal when I try to solve some problems this morning. Eventually I still turn to Go..so sad:(

So I decide to slow down my leetcode solutions cause I must finish my homework and prepare for my final exam.

Well, why do this college still like to use c and cpp to teach data structure and algorithms and force students to finish the test paper with it instead of python and java? At least they are more user-friendly and can help me accelerate the pace of learning programming to solve the real problem and do some projects to enhance my self-confidence. And when I turn to computer architecture after studying algorithms, that is the proper time to gain some knowledege about c and cpp.

Now I need an internship to improve my skills and try to work and study in a real environment. 

Time is so fast.
